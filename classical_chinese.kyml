Removing to a house near the market-place, she found that the boy now began to play at buying and selling; and fearing the ill effect of these sordid associations, she next sought shelter near a college. There the young philosopher began to imitate the ceremonial observances in which the students were instructed, to the great joy and satisfaction of his mother. (Giles)

        Kuo fêng, the manners and customs of the States, is the title of the first section of the Book of Poetry. It is so called because it was customary for the various rulers of the Feudal States to forward to their suzerain, 天子 t'ien tzŭ the Son of Heaven, such ballads as were commonly sung by the people under their jurisdiction. These were then submitted to the Imperial Musicians, who were able to judge from their nature of the manners and customs prevailing in the various States, and the suzerain was thus enlightened as to the administration of his vassal Princes. (Giles)

        Kung-yang is here a double surname, being that of the author of one of the three commentaries on the Spring and Autumn Annals, who flourished in the 5th cent. B.C. Like that of Ku-liang it is much inferior to the great work of Tso; indeed, from striking similarities in the two former, it has been suspected either that one is a copy of the other or that both may be from the same hand. (Giles)

        [Zuo] stands for the surname of 左邱明 Tso-ch'iu Ming, the most important of the three commentators and a reputed disciple of Confucius. His commentary is of infinitely more value, from every point of view, than the original text, and is popularly known as the Tso Chuan. Giles)

        The last two characters are the double surname of the third commentator, who lived in the 5th cent. B.C. (Giles)

      notes: |-
        The meaning is that the Sung dynasty ruled under the guiding influence of fire as its own especial element. (Giles)

        The [resignation] reference is to the six-year-old son of the last Emperor of the Later Chou dynasty, who resigned in A.D. 960 in favour of the founder of the Sung dynasty. (Giles)

        The Sung dynasty was interrupted in A.D. 1127 by the 金 Chin Tartars, who had been called in to exterminate the 遼 Liao Tartars, carrying off the Emperor and his heir and occupying the northern portion of the empire. Another son of the unfortunate monarch succeeded in re-establishing the line, and for greater security transferred his capital southwards to modern Hangchow. Hence the first period was called the Northern, the latter the Southern, Sung; and it is to the final reunion of the two under the Mongol Emperor Kublai Khan in A.D. 1260 that this line refers, although the last representative of the Sungs lived on until 1279.

        The whole world recognizes the beautiful as the beautiful, yet this is only the ugly;

        Note and sound harmonize with each other; 
        Before and after follow each other.  
          
        Therefore the sage keeps to the deed that consists in taking no action and practises the teaching that uses no words.  
          
        The myriad creatures rise from it yet it claims no authority; 
        It gives them life yet claims no possession; 
        It benefits them yet exacts no gratitude; 
        It accomplishes its task yet lays claim to no merit.  
          
        It is because it lays claim to no merit 
        That its merit never deserts it.

        Therefore in governing the people, the sage empties their minds but fills their bellies, weakens their wills but strengthens their bones. 
        He always keeps them innocent of knowledge and free from desire, and ensures that the clever never dare to act.

        In order to keep in control the realm of today. 
        The ability to know the beginning of antiquity 
        Is called the thread running through the way.

        Of old he who was well versed in the way 
        Was minutely subtle, mysteriously comprehending, 
        And too profound to be known. 
        It is because he could not be known 
        That he can only be given a makeshift description:  
          
        Tentative, as if fording a river in winter, 
        Hesitant, as if in fear of his neighbors; 
        Formal like a guest; 
        Falling apart like the thawing ice; 
        Thick like the uncarved block; 
        Vacant like a valley; 
        Murky like muddy water.  
          
        Who can be muddy and yet, settling, slowly become limpid? 
        Who can be at rest and yet, stirring, slowly come to life? 
        He who holds fast to this way 
        Desires not to be full. 
        It is because he is not full 
        That he can be worn and yet newly made.

        A little then benefited; 
        A lot then perplexed.  
          
        Therefore the sage embraces the One and is a model for the empire.  
          
        He does not show himself, and so is conspicuous; 
        He does not consider himself right, and so is illustrious; 
        He does not brag, and so has merit; 
        He does not boast, and so endures.  
          
        It is because he does not contend that no one in the empire is in a position to contend with him.  
          
        The way the ancients had it, 'Bowed down then preserved', is no empty saying. 
        Truly it enables one to be preserved to the end.

        To use words but rarely 
        Is to be natural.  
          
        Hence a gusty wind cannot last all morning, and a sudden downpour cannot last all day. 
        Who is it that produces these? Heaven and earth. 
        If even heaven and earth cannot go on forever, much less can man. 
        That is why one follows the way.  
          
        A man of the way conforms to the way; 
        A man of virtue conforms to virtue; 
        A man of loss conforms to loss. 
        He who conforms to the way is gladly accepted by the way; 
        He who conforms to virtue is gladly accepted by virtue; 
        He who conforms to loss is gladly accepted by loss.

        I give it the makeshift name of 'the great'. 
        Being great, it is further described as receding, 
        Receding, it is described as far away, 
        Being far away, it is described as turning back.

        It is because arms are instruments of ill omen and there are Things that detest them that the one who has the way does not abide by their use. 
        The gentleman gives precedence to the left when at home, but to the right when he goes to war. 
        Arms are instruments of ill omen, not the instruments of the gentleman. 
        When one is compelled to use them, it is best to do so without relish. 
        There is no glory in victory, and so to glorify it despite this is to exult in the killing of men. 
        One who exults in the killing of men will never have his way in the empire. 
        On occasions of rejoicing precedence is given to the left; 
        On occasions of mourning precedence is given to the right. 
        A lieutenants place is on the left; 
        The general's place is on the right. 
        This means that it is mourning rites that are observed. 
        When great numbers of people are killed, one should weep over them with sorrow. 
        When victorious in war, one should observe the rites of mourning.

        A man of the highest virtue does not keep to virtue and that is why he has virtue.

        The latter acts but there are things left undone. 
        A man of the highest benevolence acts, but from no ulterior motive. 
        A man of the highest rectitude acts, but from ulterior motive. 
        A man most conversant in the rites acts, but when no one responds rolls up his sleeves and resorts to persuasion by force.  
          
        Hence when the way was lost there was virtue; 
        When virtue was lost there was benevolence; 
        When benevolence was lost there was rectitude; 
        When rectitude was lost there were the rites.  
          
        The rites are the wearing thin of loyalty and good faith 
        And the beginning of disorder; 
        Foreknowledge is the flowery embellishment of the way 
        And the beginning of folly.

        Of old, these came to be in possession of the One: 
        Heaven in virtue of the One is limpid; 
        Earth in virtue of the One is settled; 
        Gods in virtue of the One have their potencies; 
        The valley in virtue of the One is full; 
        The myriad creatures in virtue of the One are alive; 
        Lords and princes in virtue of the One become leaders of the empire. 
        It is the One that makes these what they are.  
          
        Without what makes it limpid heaven might split; 
        Without what makes it settled earth might sink; 
        Without what gives them their potencies gods might spend themselves; 
        Without what makes it full the valley might run dry; 
        Without what keeps them alive the myriad creatures might perish; 
        Without what makes them leaders lords and princes might fall.  
          
        Hence the superior must have the inferior as root; 
        The high must have the low as base.  
          
        Thus lords and princes refer to themselves as 'solitary', 'desolate', and 'hapless'. 
        This is taking the inferior as root, is it not?  
          
        Hence the highest renown is without renown, 
        Not wishing to be one among many like jade 
        Nor to be aloof like stone.

        When the best student hears about the way 
        He practises it assiduously; 
        When the average student hears about the way 
        It seems to him there one moment and gone the next; 
        When the worst student hears about the way 
        He laughs out loud. 
        If he did not laugh 
        It would be unworthy of being the way.  
          
        Hence the Chien yen has it: 
        The way that is bright seems dull; 
        The way that is forward seems to lead backward; 
        The way that is even seems rough. 
        The highest virtue is like the valley; 
        The sheerest whiteness seems sullied; 
        Ample virtue seems defective; 
        Vigorous virtue seems indolent; 
        Plain virtue seems soiled; 
        The great square has no corners. 
        The great vessel takes long to complete; 
        The great note is rarefied in sound; 
        The great image has no shape.  
          
        The way conceals itself in being nameless. 
        It is the way alone that excels in bestowing and in accomplishing.

        The myriad creatures carry on their backs the yin and embrace in their arms the yang and are the blending of the generative forces of the two.  
          
        There are no words which men detest more than 'solitary', 'desolate', and 'hapless', yet lords and princes use these to refer to themselves.  
          
        Thus a thing is sometimes added to by being diminished and diminished by being added to.

        'The violent shall not come to a natural end.' 
        I shall take this as my precept.

        When going one way means life and going the other means death, three in ten will be comrades in life, three in ten will be comrades in death, and there are those who value life and as a result move into the realm of death, and these also number three in ten. 
        Why is this so? Because they set too much store by life. 
        I have heard it said that one who excels in safeguarding his own life does not meet with rhinoceros or tiger when travelling on land nor is he touched by weapons when charging into an army. 
        There is nowhere for the rhinoceros to pitch its horn; 
        There is nowhere for the tiger to place its claws; 
        There is nowhere for the weapon to lodge its blade. 
        Why is this so? Because for him there is no realm of death.

        The world had a beginning 
        And this beginning could be the mother of the world. 
        When you know the mother 
        Go on to know the child. 
        After you have known the child 
        Go back to holding fast to the mother, 
        And to the end of your days you will not meet with danger.  
          
        Block the openings, 
        Shut the doors, 
        And all your life you will not run dry. 
        Unblock the openings, 
        Add to your troubles, 
        And to the end of your days you will be beyond salvation.  
          
        To see the small is called discernment; 
        To hold fast to the submissive is called strength. 
        Use the light 
        But give up the discernment. 
        Bring not misfortune upon yourself.  
          
        This is known as following the constant.

        Were I possessed of the least knowledge, I would, when walking on the great way, fear only paths that lead astray. 
        The great way is easy, yet people prefer by-paths.  
          
        The court is corrupt, 
        The fields are overgrown with weeds, 
        The granaries are empty; 
        Yet there are those dressed in fineries, 
        With swords at their sides, 
        Filled with food and drink, 
        And possessed of too much wealth. 
        This is known as taking the lead in robbery.  
          
        Far indeed is this from the way.

        This is because its harmony is at its height. 
        To know harmony is called the constant; 
        To know the constant is called discernment.

        Following the way from the start he may be said to accumulate an abundance of virtue; 
        Accumulating an abundance of virtue there is nothing he cannot overcome;

        A large state is the lower reaches of a river: 
        The place where all the streams of the world unite.  
          
        In the union of the world, 
        The female always gets the better of the male by stillness.  
          
        Being still, she takes the lower position.  
          
        Hence the large state, by taking the lower position, annexes the small state; 
        The small state, by taking the lower position, affiliates itself to the large state.  
          
        Thus the one, by taking the lower position, annexes; 
        The other, by taking the lower position, is annexed. 
        All that the large state wants is to take the other under its wing; 
        All that the small state wants is to have its services accepted by the other. 
        If each of the two wants to find its proper place, 
        It is meet that the large should take the lower position.

        The way is the refuge for the myriad creatures. 
        It is that by which the good man protects, 
        And that by which the bad is protected.  
          
        Beautiful words when offered will win high rank in return; 
        Beautiful deeds can raise a man above others.  
          
        Even if a man is not good, why should he be abandoned?  
          
        Hence when the emperor is set up and the three ducal ministers are appointed, he who makes a present of the way without stirring from his seat is preferable to one who offers presents of jade disks followed by a team of four horses. 
        Why was this way valued of old? 
        Was it not said that by means of it one got what one wanted and escaped the consequences when one transgressed?  
          
        Therefore it is valued by the empire.

        One who is in the habit of considering things easy meets with frequent difficulties.

        It is easy to maintain a situation while it is still secure;

        It is easy to dissolve a thing when it is yet minute.

        Keep a thing in order before disorder sets in.

        Learns to be without learning 
        And makes good the mistakes of the multitude 
        In order to help the myriad creatures to be natural and to refrain from daring to act.

        Of old those who excelled in the pursuit of the way did not use it to enlighten the people but to hoodwink them. 
        The reason why the people are difficult to govern is that they are too clever.  
          
        Hence to rule a state by cleverness 
        Will be to the detriment of the state; 
        Not to rule a state by cleverness 
        Will be a boon to the state. 
        These two are models. 
        Always to know the models 
        Is known as mysterious virtue. 
        Mysterious virtue is profound and far-reaching, 
        But when things turn back it turns back with them.  
          
        Only then is complete conformity realized.

        The strategists have a saying, 
        I dare not play the host but play the guest, 
        I dare not advance an inch but retreat a foot instead.  
          
        This is known as marching forward when there is no road, 
        Rolling up one's sleeves when there is no arm, 
        Dragging one's adversary by force when there is no adversary, 
        And taking up arms when there are no arms.  
          
        There is no disaster greater than taking on an enemy too easily. 
        So doing nearly cost me my treasure. 
        Thus of two sides raising arms against each other, 
        It is the one that is sorrow-stricken that wins.

        My words are very easy to understand and very easy to put into practice, 
        Yet no one in the world can understand them or put them into practice.  
          
        Words have an ancestor and affairs have a sovereign.  
          
        It is because people are ignorant that they fail to understand me. 
        Those who understand me are few; 
        Those who harm me are honoured.

        One who takes on himself the humiliation of the state 
        Is called a ruler worthy of offering sacrifices to the gods of earth and millet. 
        One who takes on himself the calamity of the state

        Though adjoining states are within sight of one another, 
        And the sound of dogs barking and cocks crowing in one state can be heard in another, 
        yet the people of one state will grow old and die without having had any dealings with those of another.

        Truthful words are not beautiful; 
        Beautiful words are not truthful. 
        Good words are not persuasive; 
        Persuasive words are not good. 
        He who knows has no wide learning; 
        He who has wide learning does not know.  
          
        The sage does not hoard. 
        Having bestowed all he has on others, he has yet more; 
        Having given all he has to others, he is richer still.  
          
        The way of heaven benefits and does not harm; 
        The way of the sage is bountiful and does not contend.
